# Just a toy showing bezier curve

Ok, when I was attending our Compiter Graphics class, I was told that the bezier curve is a very important thing in computer graphics.

However, I get bored of just reading the theory, so I decide to write a toy to show the bezier curve.

The code is very simple, and I think it is easy to understand. It was written just for fun, and was completed on class, so I didn't care about the efficiency.
